					<div class="question">
					Why are you going US?
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
					To study masters in Data Science at Michigan Technological University.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="qna">
					<div class="question">
					Why only US, why not India?
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
					I researched the universities in India that are offering data science programmes and came to know that India
					has limited options, like a postgraduate diploma in DS, and that too from universities that are not renowned
					for their curriculum. whereas American institutions are known to have high academic standards and follow rigorous
					practises to maintain quality. Moreover, US universities have excellent support systems for international students.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="qna">
					<div class="question">
					Tell me about the university you are going to.
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
					Michigan Technological University is a public research university in Houghton.
					In 2017, Forbes recognised Michigan Technological University as one of the top 25 STEM institutions.
					The student to faculty ratio at michigan tech is 13:1.
					Nobel laureate Melvin Calvin earned his Bachelor of Science from the Michigan Tech.
					I'm extremely excited to be a part of the multicultural student community at Michigan Tech ,
					which is a home to more than 7000 students from more than 55 different countries.
					</div>

				<div class="qna">
					<div class="question">
					Why Masters?
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
					I wish to pursue my career as a data scientist, but I could not learn adequate courses related to it in my undergrad.
					Now I wish to complete my knowledge by getting a master's degree from Michigan Tech, which gives me a great 
					possibility of becoming a data scientist in India.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="qna">
					<div class="question">
					Why this university?
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
					MTU houses the centre for Data Sciences and Scalable Systems labs which focuses on advanced research in Algorithms,
					Big Data and Data Intensive Computing. These are my areas of interests. This research group is led by Professor Laura Brown, 
                    who works in data science and its applications. I am incredibly happy to be a student at the university where Donald Shell, the computer 
					scientist who created Shell sort, obtained his bachelor's degree in science and worked as a teacher.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="qna">
					<div class="question">
					Why this course?
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
					During my bachelor's, I was engrossed in subjects like liner algebra, vector calculus, and data structures.
					This led me to develop an interest in data science. This interest made me choose my undergrad project as an 
					application of data science and image processing, in which a set of data is used to detect the kidney stone.
					And now I want to become a data scientist by getting this master's degree in this selected field.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="qna">
					<div class="question">
					Why should I approve your visa?
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
					I'm interested in data science and want to learn more about it. There are not many experts in this field in India.
					The knowledge I gain while studying at Michigan Tech will help me stand out once I return to India.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="qna">
					<div class="question">
					What are your plans if I reject your visa?
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
					It's my long wish to get a master's degree from top universities like Michigan Tech, but I still respect the
					decision of the embassy, and then I’ll try for my next application and prepare the necessary documents required
					for my second chance.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="qna">
					<div class="question">
					Tell me about your undergrad project.
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
					My undergrad project is kidney stone detection. In this project, a model is created and trained using a set of data
					in the form of images. The input to the model is an ultrasound scan of the kidney. This input is preprocessed and
					filtered to remove unwanted data and noise. Then the model classifies the input image based on the training data.
					If there is any stone in the kidney, the computer displays the text "stone is present in the kidney" and identifies
					the area of the kidney where the stone is present; otherwise, it displays that there are no stones in the kidney.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="qna">
					<div class="question">
					what are the benefits of Data Science?
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
					Data science is being widely used in many sectors, like healthcare, the banking sector, entertainment, and e-commerce.
					With the help of data science tools and machine learning algorithms, we can detect and trace cancer and tumors. 
					In the banking sector, data science plays a key role in predicting fraudulent transactions. On apps like Netflix 
					and Amazon, suggestions of movies, webseries, and products are made to the user based on previous interaction with 
					the application.
