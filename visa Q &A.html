					<div class="question">
					Why are you going US?
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
					To study masters in Data Science at Michigan Technological University.

				<div class="qna">
					<div class="question">
					Why only US, why not India?
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
					I researched the universities in India that are offering data science programmes and came to know that India
					has limited options, like a postgraduate diploma in DS, and that too from universities that are not renowned
					for their curriculum. whereas American institutions are known to have high academic standards and follow rigorous
					practises to maintain quality. Moreover, US universities have excellent support systems for international students.

				<div class="qna">
					<div class="question">
					Tell me about the university you are going to.
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
					Michigan Technological University is a public research university in Houghton.
					In 2017, Forbes recognised Michigan Technological University as one of the top 25 STEM institutions.
					The student to faculty ratio at michigan tech is 13:1.
					Nobel laureate Melvin Calvin earned his Bachelor of Science from the Michigan Tech.
					I'm extremely excited to be a part of the multicultural student community at Michigan Tech ,
					which is a home to more than 7000 students from more than 55 different countries.

					<div class="question">
					Why Masters?
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
					Masters degree from university like Michigan Tech gives me a great possiblity 
					in becoming Data Analyst/Data Scientist in India. This degree adds an additional weight to resume, 
					to become a Data Stienctist.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="qna">
					<div class="question">
					Why this university?
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
					MTU houses the centre for Data Sciences and Scalable Systems labs which focuses on advanced research in Algorithms,
					Big Data and Data Intensive Computing. These are my areas of interests. This research group is led by Professor Laura Brown, 
                    who works in data science and its applications. I am incredibly happy to be a student at the university where Donald Shell, the computer 
					scientist who created Shell sort, obtained his bachelor's degree in science and worked as a teacher.
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="qna">
					<div class="question">
					Why this course?
					</div>
					<div class="answer">
					During my bachelor's, I was engrossed in subjects like liner algebra, vector calculus, and data structures.
					This led me to develop an interest in data science. This interest made me choose my undergrad project as an 
					application of data science and image processing, in which a set of data is used to detect the kidney stone.
					And now I want to become a data scientist by getting this master's degree in this selected field.
